Code Repository
=========================

This project is my personal code repository. The codes for learning the algorithm and data structure include:

- The solutions to some questions.
- The templates of some classical algorithms.

Most of the codes are written to prepare the competition which named ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, ICPC. Therefore, the repository is named "acm".

Codes
-----------------

The folder contains the codes that are the solution of the question in some Online Judging systems. These Online Judging systems are listed below:

- [BNU](http://www.bnuoj.com/v3/index.php): Online Judge for the Beijing Normal University.
- [CodeForces](http://codeforces.com/): The biggest Online Judge in Russia for programming competitions and contests.
- [FZU](http://acm.fzu.edu.cn/): Online Judge for the Fuzhou University.
- [HDU](http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/): Online Judge for the Hangzhou Dianzi University.
- [HIHO](https://hihocoder.com/): HihoCoder is a community in China to learn and practice, compete and make friends, stand out and get hired.
- [LOJ](http://www.lightoj.com/login_main.php): Light Online Judge.
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/): The World's Leading Online Programming Learning Platform.
- [POJ](http://poj.org/): Online Judge for the Peking University.
- [SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/): Sphere Online Judge.
- [URAL](http://acm.timus.ru/): Timus Online Judge is the largest Russian archive of programming problems with automatic judging system.
- [UVA](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/): UVa Online Judge is an online automated judge for programming problems hosted by University of Valladolid.
- [ZOJ](http://acm.zju.edu.cn/onlinejudge/): Online Judge for the Zhejiang University.

There are `2061` problems I have solved. To run the command for calculating the number of solution code:

```
$ ls -lR codes | grep cpp | wc -l
```


Templates
-----------------

There are some templates about the classical algorithm and data structure, the content are listed below:


**Basic Algorithm**
- [Sorting algorithm](https://github.com/JeraKrs/acm/tree/master/templates/basic_algorithm/sorting): bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, shell sort, heap sort, merge sort, quick sort, counting sort, radix sort.

**Data Structure**
- Linear list: queue, stack, linked list, skip list.
- String: Manachar, KMP.
- Tree: binary tree, segment tree.

**Number Theory**
- Prime number:
- Exponentiation by squaring:
- Game theory:

**Computational Geometry**

**Graph Theory**
