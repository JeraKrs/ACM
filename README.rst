Code Repository
=========================

This project is my personal code repository. The codes for learning the algorithm and data structure include:

- The solutions to some questions.
- The templates of some classical algorithms.

Most of the codes are written to prepare the competition which named ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, ICPC. Therefore, the repository is named "acm".

Codes

The folder contains the codes which are the solution of the question in some Online Judging systems. These Online Judging systems are listed below:

- [BNU](http://www.bnuoj.com/v3/index.php), Online Judge for Beijing Normal University
